# Tooltips Component

**Currently Empty Directory**

This directory is reserved for tooltip components that will provide contextual information and help text throughout the application.

## Planned Features

When implemented, the tooltip components will include:
- Hover and focus-triggered tooltips
- Multiple positioning options (top, bottom, left, right)
- Customizable styling and themes
- Rich content support (text, icons, formatted content)
- Accessibility compliance with proper ARIA attributes
- Responsive behavior for mobile devices

## Future Usage

```typescript
// Planned API (not yet implemented)
import { Tooltip } from '@/ui-components';

<Tooltip content="Helpful information" position="top">
  <Button>Hover me</Button>
</Tooltip>
```

This directory structure is prepared for upcoming tooltip implementations that will enhance user experience by providing contextual help and information.
